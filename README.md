# CarrierGoose
A web app that delivers your to-do list with a friendly message to your phone by text message.

## Inspiration
As busy students with various assignments and pursuits, we often lose track of menial tasks like taking out the trash or calling our mothers. Carrier Goose serves as a solution to ensure we remember to get everything done.

## How we built it
The text message functionality of the app is powered by Twilio's SMS API in NodeJS, using the ExpressJS framework and bodyParser middleware to transport data from the client to the server. The web app is run on Heroku using HTML/EJS, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Why it Works
How often do you jot down your tasks in a to-do list or take a photo of things to do just to never open or look at it again? With Carrier Goose pinned to the top of your text messages, you'll be reminded of your tasks of the day every time you check your texts.
