## Backstory
### Inspiration
As 1A students at the University of Waterloo, we faced many struggles in our first two weeks of university attempting to remember all the new information. We naturally began to quiz each other on concepts throughout the day. Thus, when Hack the North came along and we discovered Twilio’s intuitive SMS API, we were inspired to automate this process and quiz ourselves on topics we struggle with most.

### What it does
Studies in education and memory show that students retain facts and concepts better if exposed to them over a prolonged period of time, rather than cramming in one sitting. Career Goose allows users to input quiz questions and flashcards to receive them throughout the day as SMS messages, reinforcing the information.

### How we built it
We implemented Twilio’s SMS API in a web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS and ExpressJS.

### Challenges we ran into
Lacking experience and knowledge in NodeJS and ExpressJS proved to come with many challenges in the implementation of the Twilio SMS API. We set out to learn as much JavaScript, NodeJS, and ExpressJS as we could with our limited free time. As well, creating solutions to prevent abuse of our app proved to be challenging.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
After leaving the project incomplete at Hack the North in Fall 2021, we returned to the challenge during our Winter Break. We are very proud to have been able to return to this project and create what we imagined at Hack the North.

### What we learned
We completed a JavaScript course to solidify our foundation, before completely redesigning the web app and learning NodeJS and ExpressJS to implement the Twilio SMS API.

### What's next for Carrier Goose
Carrier Goose's next step is to be hosted online for public use.
